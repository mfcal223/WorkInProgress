🔰 Team Git Workflow Guide 🔰
============================

📌 Scenario: You`re working on a feature or update in a personal branch (e.g., develop_Name) and need to push it to main.

🔁 Step-by-Step Git Workflow
---------------------------

🔹 1. Create or switch to your personal branch

	> git checkout -b develop_YourName   # If creating a new branch
	
> git checkout develop_YourName      # Switch to a branch that already exists


🔹 2. Make your changes locally
//Edit your files as needed.
Check status:
	> git status

🔹 3. Stage and commit your changes
	> git add .                           # Or specify files
	> git commit -m "Describe your update briefly"

🔹 4. Push your branch to GitHub
🚨 If it`s your first push of this branch:
	> git push -u origin develop_YourName

📥 For later pushes:
> git push

🔹 5. Merge your changes into main when ready
	a. Switch to main
		> git checkout main
	b. Pull the latest version of main
		> git pull origin main
	c. Merge your branch into main
		> git merge develop_YourName

🔹 6. Push the updated main branch to GitHub
	> git push origin main

✅ Now your changes are live on main and visible to everyone.

🔹 7. (Optional) Clean up your branch
If the feature is complete and no longer needed:
git branch -d develop_YourName                		# Delete local branch
git push origin --delete develop_YourName     		# Delete remote branch (if agreed by team)
💡 Tips for Team Collaboration
==============================
⭐ Always pull the latest main before starting a new feature.
⭐ Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
⭐ Coordinate with the team before merging large updates.
⭐ If conflicts happen during merge, check the following section.

⚔️ How to Solve Merge Conflicts ⚔️
===================================
If you see something like this during merge:

"CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in somefile.c
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

🧹 Step-by-step:

1. Open the file and look for conflict markers:
     <<<<<<< HEAD
   code from main
   =======
   code from develop_YourName
   >>>>>>> develop_YourName

2. Manually edit and keep the correct version.

3. After editing:
> git add somefile.c

4. Then commit the merge:
> git commit

5. Finally, push the resolved version:
> git push origin main


☕️ Morning Git Ritual: Pull the Latest
===================================
Before you do anything else, it’s a great habit to:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Why?
To make sure you’re working on top of the latest team code.
Avoid future merge conflicts by starting with an up-to-date base.

✅ Then: Start Your New Task
After pulling main, you can either:
🔹 Create a new branch:
git checkout -b develop_Flor_taskX

🔹 Or update your existing branch with the latest main:
git checkout develop_Flor
git rebase main

(Rebase is great to keep history clean. I can help with that if you’d like!)

/////////////////////
After update from own branch has been merge into main, and after pull request approved: 

from own branch: 
> git fetch origin
> git rebase origin/main
> git push

## 🧩 Suggested Division of Work

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Agreement**
> ⏱️ Duration: 1–2 days  
> 👥 Work together  
**Both teammates** should:
- Agree on a **project structure** (`/src`, `/inc`, `/libft`, etc.).
- Set up a basic **Makefile**, **libft integration**, and shared **structs** in headers.
- Create a **main loop** with a minimal working prompt (`readline`, `printf`, etc.).
- Decide how to manage global state (e.g., `g_exit_status`, error messages, etc.).

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Role-Based Development

### 👤 **Teammate A – Signal Expert**
Focus: **User Input Handling, Signals, Builtins**

#### Tasks:
- Implement signal handling:
  - `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C), `SIGQUIT` (Ctrl+\), and `EOF` (Ctrl+D).
  - Setup proper behavior in **interactive mode**.
- Manage and process input:
  - Handle unclosed quotes, prompt re-display.
  - Setup `readline()` and `add_history()`.
- Implement **builtins** (excluding those that require forking, like `env`, `exit`):
  - `cd`, `export`, `unset`, `pwd`, `echo`.

---

### 👤 **Teammate B – Pipes & Fork Expert**
Focus: **Execution Engine, Redirections, Pipes**

#### Tasks:
- Implement command execution engine:
  - Handle **fork**, **execve**, **waitpid**, return codes.
  - Search for binaries via `PATH`.
- Build the **pipe system**:
  - Support pipelines (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3`).
  - Proper `dup2` and `close` handling.
- Handle **redirections**:
  - Input/output (`<`, `>`, `>>`) and **here_doc** (`<<`).
- Implement builtins that run inside forks:
  - `env`, `exit`.

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Merge & Integrate

> ⏱️ Duration: 2–3 days  
> 👥 Work together again

- Merge parser with execution logic.
- Ensure builtins run correctly inside and outside of child processes.
- Handle edge cases:
  - Expansion of `$?`, invalid redirections, quotes inside heredocs.
- Write signal-safe code and avoid leaks.

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & Debugging

- Write test scripts for:
  - Syntax errors
  - Piped commands
  - Redirections (especially nested)
  - Ctrl+C/D signals
- Run valgrind for **leak checks**.
- Create a defense folder with test inputs.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Agree on **naming conventions and code style** (stick to 42 Norm).
- Comment or document shared structs and flags.
- Use a **shared Trello/Notion board** or TODO.txt to track progress.
- Use `git` branches or flags (`DEV_PIPE`, `DEV_SIG`) to avoid conflicts.

✅ 1) Project Structure & What Structs You Might Need
A solid folder structure makes your teamwork and code much more manageable. Here's a common and clean structure:

pgsql
Copiar
Editar
minishell/
├── Makefile
├── src/
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── prompt/
│   │   ├── prompt.c
│   ├── parser/
│   │   ├── tokenizer.c
│   │   ├── parser.c
│   ├── executor/
│   │   ├── execute.c
│   │   ├── pipe.c
│   │   ├── redirections.c
│   ├── builtins/
│   │   ├── builtin_cd.c
│   │   ├── builtin_env.c
│   │   ├── builtin_exit.c
│   ├── signals/
│   │   ├── signals.c
│   └── utils/
│       ├── env_utils.c
│       ├── str_utils.c
│       ├── errors.c
├── inc/
│   └── minishell.h
├── libft/
│   └── (your libft files)
✅ Example Structs
You'll need a few central data structures:

// in minishell.h
typedef struct s_token
{
	char			*value;
	int				type;
	struct s_token	*next;
}	t_token;

typedef struct s_cmd
{
	char	**args;
	int		infile;
	int		outfile;
	int		is_builtin;
	struct s_cmd *next;
}	t_cmd;

typedef struct s_shell
{
	char	**envp;
	t_cmd	*cmd_list;
}	t_shell;
These structures help organize commands, tokens, and overall shell state.

✅ 2) Minimal Working Prompt with readline
You’ll want a basic interactive loop that:

Displays a prompt

Reads input from the user

Exits gracefully on EOF (Ctrl+D)


🧠 Note: readline() already handles Ctrl+C line-killing for you. Later you’ll override its behavior with custom signal handlers.

🔹 Includes
#include "minishell.h"
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>
minishell.h: Your custom header file (you'll define structs, functions, macros, etc. here).

readline.h and history.h: Part of the GNU Readline library, which gives you:

readline(): Reads a line of user input with a prompt.

add_history(): Saves commands to the shell history (so up/down arrows work).

🔹 Function Signature

int	main(int ac, char **av, char **envp)
Standard main() for a C program.

ac (argument count) and av (argument values) are unused here for now.

envp: Array of environment variables (you’ll likely store this in a global struct later).

🔹 Ignore Unused Arguments

(void)ac;
(void)av;
This is a trick to silence compiler warnings about unused variables.

Since ac and av aren't used yet, casting them to (void) tells the compiler "yes, I meant to ignore them."

🔹 Infinite Shell Loop
c

while (1)
Runs forever, unless something breaks the loop.

This is the shell's main REPL loop: Read-Eval-Print Loop.

🔹 Readline Prompt

input = readline("minishell$ ");
Displays a prompt like minishell$ and waits for user input.

Returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated string (you must free() it).

If the user hits Ctrl+D, readline() returns NULL.

🔹 Handle EOF (Ctrl+D)

if (!input)
{
	printf("exit\n");
	break;
}
If the user presses Ctrl+D, input == NULL.

This simulates how bash exits with exit when you hit Ctrl+D.

🔹 Add Command to History

if (*input)
	add_history(input);
Only add to history if the input is not an empty string.

Lets user press ↑ to repeat previous commands (just like bash).

🔹 Debug Output for Now

printf("You typed: %s\n", input); // Replace this later with parsing
Temporary placeholder to prove input was received.

Later, you'll replace this with tokenizing, parsing, and executing the command.

🔹 Free Input String

free(input);
Always free the result of readline() after you're done using it.

Prevents memory leaks — very important for Minishell.

🔹 Return Exit Code

return (0);
Exits the shell with status 0.

Later, you'll return *get_exit_status() or similar to reflect the last command result.


✅ 3) Managing Global State (e.g., Exit Codes, Errors)
Minishell is long-running, so you need a consistent way to store and access:

The last exit status ($?)

Signal status (e.g., if SIGINT was received)

Maybe the current shell environment

✅ Why Only One Global?
The subject strictly limits you to only one global variable, and it can only store a signal number (not a pointer or struct).

So you cannot do:

t_shell *g_shell; // ❌ NOT ALLOWED by the subject
✅ How to Do It Right
Use a static variable with accessors, like this:

// in a file called state.c
int	*get_exit_status(void)
{
	static int	status = 0;
	return (&status);
}
Then in any part of your code:

*get_exit_status() = 127; // Update exit status
printf("Exit: %d\n", *get_exit_status());
🧠 This lets you "fake" global variables:
It obeys Norminette

You get "shared state" across your project

You can do the same for signal flags or other single values you might want to access across files.
