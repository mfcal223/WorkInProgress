please do not change the variable or function names randomly.
If you want to change a variable name, please explain or clarify the reason. otherwise is confusing.

1- modify print_msg():

my struct has a "print_lock()" . why did you change it for death_lock in this function?

Here is current version of print_msg()

void	print_msg(t_philo *philo, const char *msg)
{
	uint64_t	timestamp;

	pthread_mutex_lock(&philo->data->print_lock);
	timestamp = get_time_ms() - philo->data->start_time;
	if (philo->data->keep_iterating)
		printf("%lu %d %s\n", timestamp, philo->id, msg);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&philo->data->print_lock);
}

could I replace "	if (philo->data->keep_iterating)" with a called to check_keep_iterating()?

2- check_keep_iterating() looks as the code you are suggesting.

3- in end_simulation()
I`ve added the if{} in case the simulation already ended

4- Check initialization: yes, both variables are initialized like that.
5- I am not sure what should I check in philo_routine() but you hace current version in the repository
