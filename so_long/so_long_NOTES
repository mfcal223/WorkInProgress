MINILIBX is an X server which allows "things" to be display on screen. 
It is build based on X.org library. This API allows display on screen think for beginners.


/* SETTING UP MINILIBX*/

Download the .zip. Extract it in the root folder of project.
Navigate into the minilibx folder and compile it. 
$> make

After running make, ensure that a libmlx.a file is created inside the MiniLibX 
directory. This static library will be linked when compiling your project.


/*MAKE FILES NOTES */
- ISSUE COMPILING AND INCLUDING HEADER
in your Makefile, you already have this line:
Makefile
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror -I$(INC_DIR) -I$(MLX_DIR) -I$(LIBFT_DIR)/inc
This is correct because it adds the minilibx-linux directory to the include path with -I$(MLX_DIR).

The error is occurring because:

You're trying to include the file as "minilibx-linux/mlx.h" in your header, but
The compiler is already being told to look in the minilibx-linux directory through the -I flag
When you use the -I flag in the compiler, it adds that directory to the search path, so you don't need to (and shouldn't) include the directory name in the include statement.

Here's what's happening:

When you write #include "minilibx-linux/mlx.h", the compiler looks for a file named exactly that
But because you've added -Iminilibx-linux to your compiler flags, the compiler is already looking in that directory, so you just need to use #include <mlx.h>
To fix this:

Modify your inc/so_long.h file as shown above
(# include <mlx.h>           /* This is the correct way when using -I flag */)


/*-------------------------------------*/

INITIALIZATION:

BASIC WINDOW MANAGEMENT: 
----------------------
(1) 
mlx_init():
 This will establish a connection to the correct graphical system and will return a void * which holds the location of our current MLX instance.

This sparks the connection to the X-server.

(2)
mlx_new_window()
This will return a pointer to the window we have just created. We can give the window height, width and a title.

A window is just a huge gigantic malloc.

(3)
mlx_loop() to initiate the window rendering.
This keeps the process "alive".
It is an >>event loop<<.

(4)
mlx_key_hook() ?????

"Hooking into events" = reacting to events, like pressing a key. Doing this triggers another function that will behave as a handler. 
Every event should have its prototype handler.

MLX_HOOK ES COMO KEY_HOOK??

(5)
mlx_hook() and mlx_destroy_window()
mlx_hook() calls an auxiliary function (I called close_window) to be able to close  the window by click the [x] on the corner.
This action will call another function of the minilibx = mlx_destroy_window()

this closes the connection and frees the display. It is a cleanup function.


(6) MLX_LOOP_HOOK
is triggered when no event is processed. pe. textthat changes color except when you press a key like SPACE


📌 WRITING PIXELS TO A IMAGE
----------------------------

To put pixels in an image:  mlx_pixel_put function is very, very slow. This is because it tries to push the pixel instantly to the window (without waiting for the frame to be entirely rendered).
Because of this sole reason, we will have to buffer all of our pixels to a image, which we will then push to the window and manage the same thing with a custom made mlx_pixel_put().

we will use a image structure. 
typedef struct s_image
{
	void	*img;
	char	*addr;
	int		bppix;
	int		line_len;
	int		endian;
}			t_image;

bppix means exactly that. 1 pixel = 1 INT = 32 bits



We create an image by doing :

img.img = mlx_new_image(mlx, 1920, 1080);

and then we can call `mlx_get_image_addr`, we pass `bppix`, `line_len`, and `endian` by reference. These will then be set accordingly for the *current* image address.

Now we have the image address, but still no pixels. Before we start with this, we must understand that the bytes are not aligned, this means that the line_len differs from the actual window width. We therefore should ALWAYS calculate the memory offset using the line length set by mlx_get_image_addr.

We can calculate it very easily by using the following formula:

int offset = (y * line_len + x * (bppix / 8));

my_mlx_pixel_put will include this calculation.

Note that this will cause an issue. Because an image is represented in real time in a window, changing the same image will cause a bunch of screen-tearing when writing to it. You should therefore create two or more images to hold your frames temporarily. You can then write to a temporary image, so that you don’t have to write to the currently presented image.



Pushing images to a window
----------------------------


📌 Explanation of mlx_string_put()
-----------------------------------
mlx_string_put() is a MiniLibX function that prints a string on the game window at a specific position.

Function Prototype (from mlx.h):

int mlx_string_put(void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr, int x, int y, int color, char *string);
Parameters:
mlx_ptr → Pointer to the MiniLibX instance (game->mlx).
win_ptr → Pointer to the game window (game->win).
x → X-coordinate (horizontal position).
y → Y-coordinate (vertical position).
color → Text color (hexadecimal format, e.g., 0xFFFFFF for white).
string → The text to display (must be a char * string).
Example:
c
Copiar
Editar
mlx_string_put(game->mlx, game->win, 10, 20, 0xFFFFFF, "Hello, World!");
✅ This prints "Hello, World!" at position (10, 20) in white (0xFFFFFF).

How to Add a Word Before moves_str
Since mlx_string_put() only takes one string, we must concatenate the word ("Moves: ") and the number (moves_str) into a new string.

✅ Solution Using ft_strjoin()
Use ft_itoa() to convert the integer game->moves to a string.
Use ft_strjoin() to concatenate "Moves: " with moves_str.
Pass the final string to mlx_string_put().
Free both moves_str and the concatenated string to avoid memory leaks.

TENER EN CUENTA QUE EN LOS HEADER HABRA QUE USAR ESTRUCTURAS QUE SE INCLUYEN ENTRE SI. lA ESTRUCTURA DE LA VENTAA INCLUIRA LA DEIMAGENES, DE MAPA, DE COORDENADAS O DE LO QUE SEA QUE HAYA QUE USAR.

Main game structure includes:
- MLX connection
- Textures and images
- Map image
- Player position (ship)
- Game state (moves, collectibles, etc.)

1. Initialization Phase --> MAIN()
Program starts by checking command line arguments (must be 2: program name and map file)
Validates map file extension (must be .ber)

2. GAME_START()
2.1 Initializes game structure (t_game in my code, t_init in malaga) with default values.
/* for this I have: 
- added another struct to be the central image structure that connects all functions:
	Contains game state
	Holds graphics resources
	Stores map information
	Tracks player position and collectibles
*/
=========================================================================================
SO_LONG.C

GAME_START()
What is "-> path"? (in malaga code , the av[1] = "path" , in my code "game")
In your ft_start_map function, path is the file path to the map that the player wants to load. It is passed as an argument from main() and stored inside the t_game (or t_init) structure.
For example:
./so_long maps/map.ber
maps/map.ber → This is stored in game->path.
- - - > Why Do We Store path?
	It allows the game to know which file to read.
	Helps when reloading or validating the map.
	If needed, you can save game progress or reload the same map.

=========================================================================================
MAP FUNCTIONS
--------------
This set of functions is central to setting up the game's environment before entering the main 
gameplay loop, ensuring that the map data is available in both linked list and array formats for
further processing.
The overall process ensures that the map is correctly read from a file, that its dimensions are 
known, and that any potential errors (like memory allocation or file I/O issues) are handled 
gracefully.
By creating duplicate arrays of the map, the code seems designed to work with an immutable 
original (or to have one copy for checking game state and another for dynamic modifications, 
such as during pathfinding).

MAP() (ft_map())
Goal: Act as the central function to initialize the entire map structure within the game.
Workflow:
-> Initialization: It stores a temporary pointer to the game structure.
-> Map Loading: It calls ft_map_init to load the map from the file into the game’s linked list.
-> Error Handling: If the map loading fails, it frees the game structure and returns an error.
-> Dimension Calculation: It computes the map’s dimensions by calling:
------ft_map_x (for the width) using the first map node.
------ft_map_y (for the height) by iterating through the list.
-> Creating Map Arrays: It then duplicates the map into two separate 2D arrays:
------array_map – likely used for storing the original state of the map.
------array_ff – possibly intended for pathfinding or gameplay modifications.
-> Finalization: If either array creation fails, it performs cleanup (using ft_free_all) and 
returns an error. Otherwise, it updates the game pointer and signals successful initialization.

MAP_INITIALIZE() (ft_map_init)
Goal: Initialize the map from a file.
Workflow:
-> File Opening: It opens the map file (whose path is stored in the game structure) in read-only 
mode.
-> Error Checking: If the file cannot be opened, it calls an error handler (ft_map_error) and 
returns NULL.
-> Line Reading: It reads the file line by line using get_next_line.
-> Validation: For each line, it calls ft_check_empty_line to ensure the file doesn’t contain any 
invalid (empty) lines.
-> Cleanup: Once all lines are processed, the file descriptor is closed.


duplicate_map() (ex- ft_map_status)
Goal: Create a 2D array (an array of strings) that is a duplicate of the map stored in a linked 
list.
Workflow:
- Backup: It first saves the current pointer to the beginning of the map linked list.
- Allocation: It allocates memory for a character pointer array sized to hold each line of the
 map (plus one extra for a terminating NULL pointer).
- Duplication: It iterates through each node in the linked list. For every node, it duplicates 
the string (using a function like ft_strdup) that represents that line of the map.
- Error Handling: If any duplication fails, it frees any allocated memory using a helper 
(likely ft_free_status) and returns NULL.
- Restoration: It resets the game’s map pointer back to its original position.
- Completion: Finally, it marks the end of the array with NULL and returns the array.

int	map_x_width(t_map *width) // = num of columns (ft_map_x) = num of char
int	map_y_heigth(t_map *height) // = num of lines (ft_map_y) = num of nodes

2.2 Map Loading and Validation

Reads map file line by line✅
Creates a linked list structure to store the map✅
Validates map requirements:
a. Must be rectangular
b. Must be surrounded by walls
c. Must contain:
 i. One player (P)
 ii. At least one collectible (C)
 iii. One exit (E)
 iiii. Must be possible to reach all collectibles and exit

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅FIND_PLAYER()
search through the game’s map (stored as a 2D array of characters in game->array_map) to 
locate the cell that represents the player. 
When it finds that cell, it updates the ship field in the game structure (of type t_coord) 
with the player's x and y coordinates.

✅map_validation() / path_valid_ff() / cell_objects()
--Validation of Map Solvability:
In many games (like so_long), it’s crucial to ensure that the level is solvable. This means the player should be able to reach all collectibles and the exit from the starting position.
--Marking Visited Cells:
By marking cells as visited (with 'F'), the algorithm avoids infinite loops and ensures that each cell is processed only once.
--Updating Game State:
As the algorithm “floods” through the accessible area, it uses helper functions (like cell_objects) to update the game state. This ensures that you know which important elements (exits, collectibles, etc.) are reachable.

After these functions run, you can compare these counters with the total number of collectibles and the expected exit count to determine if the map is valid—that is, if the player can reach all necessary elements.

! Although both path_valid_ff and cell_objects check for 'E', they serve different purposes.!

1️⃣ path_valid_ff(): Ensuring That the Exit Is Reachable
The primary role of path_valid_ff() is to perform the flood fill and ensure accessibility.
The condition if (tab[curr.y][curr.x] == 'E') stops the flood fill from passing through an exit, ensuring that the algorithm terminates early when an exit is found.
The return (game); prevents unnecessary recursive calls beyond the exit.
2️⃣ cell_objects(): Counting the Number of Exits Found
cell_objects() is used to track how many exits exist and are reachable.
While path_valid_ff() marks an exit as found and prevents further recursion, it does not count how many times an exit is encountered.
cell_objects() ensures that every encounter with an exit increases the count, which is important if there are multiple exits in the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FT_CHECK_FORM()
Iterates through each row to validates each character to ensure it belongs to the allowed set: floor (FLOOR), wall (WALL), player (PJ), collectible (C), or exit (EXIT).
also Checks if each row has the same width as the first row (game->size.x). If any row is different, it returns 1 (error).
If all rows match in length and contain only valid characters, it returns 0 (success).

🚨I AM NOT CHECKING IF THE MAP IS A SQUARE❌. i AM CHOOSING A VERY BROAD INTERPRETATION OF RECTANGLE AS IN A POLIGONE 4 FACES, WHERE EVERY LINE HAS THE SAME LENGTH, AND EVERY COLUMN THE SAME LENGTH.🚨

FT_CHECK_BORDERS()
Iterates through each row:
Ensures that the top (j == 0) and bottom (j == game->size.y - 1) rows contain only walls.
Ensures that the left (i == 0) and right (i == game->size.x - 1) edges of middle rows also contain only walls.
Returns 1 if any of these conditions fail; otherwise, returns 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
count_objectsS()

Is map->map[i] each line of the map?
Yes! Your t_map is a linked list, where:
- Each node (t_map) contains one full row of the map as a string (map->map).
- The linked list structure allows you to move to the next row using map = map->next;.

✔️ The outer while (map) loop iterates through each row in the map (linked list).
✔️ The inner while (map->map[i]) loop iterates through each character in that row.

Example: If your map file is:
1111
1P01
1C01
1E11

Then:

First node (map->map) = "1111"
Second node (map->next->map) = "1P01"
Third node (map->next->next->map) = "1C01"
Fourth node (map->next->next->next->map) = "1E11"
Each row is stored in a separate linked list node, and the function reads one row at a time while looping through each character in that row.

compare_counts()
/* compare quantity of elementes counted in the map and counted by 
flood fill (which are reachables)*/


check_min_count()
/* checks minimun quantities of main elements are fullfilled */


ft_check_failed()
/* cambiar nombre a map_check */
this functions organices the checking.
=====================================================================================

TEST DE MAPAS INVALIDOS
-----------------------
PROBLEM WHEN MAP IS NOT RECTANGULAR:
The most likely cause is that your map is not rectangular, meaning some rows are shorter than others.

Your path_valid_ff() function assumes all rows are of equal length (size.x).

If a row is shorter, then accessing tab[curr.y][curr.x] could be out of bounds.
Your duplicate_map() (or ft_strdup()) might be copying shorter rows, but path_valid_ff() assumes they are the same length.

If path_valid_ff() moves horizontally (curr.x + 1) on a short row, it accesses memory beyond the allocated row.

✅ Fix: Ensure path_valid_ff() Checks Row Length Before Accessing
Modify path_valid_ff() to check if curr.x is within the row’s actual length before accessing tab[curr.y][curr.x]:

	if (curr.x >= ft_strlen(tab[curr.y]))
		return (game);

📌 Additional Fix: Ensure ft_check_form() Detects Non-Rectangular Maps
Right now, your ft_check_form() function should already be checking for non-rectangular maps by ensuring all rows have the same length.

✅ Make sure you have this condition in ft_check_form():

if (ft_strlen(game->array_map[j]) != game->size.x)
	return (1); // Error: Rows must have same length

If this condition is already in ft_check_form(), then the invalid map should be rejected before reaching path_valid_ff().

3. Graphics Initialization

Initializes MLX42 library
Loads all required textures:
- - floor (background)
- Wall
- Ship (player) with different directions
- Collectibles
- Exit (closed and open states)
- Shark (enemy)
- Converts textures to images for display



📌 MLX_XPM_FILE_TO_IMAGE()
------------------------------- 
mlx_xpm_file_to_image automatically obtains the size of the loaded XPM image and writes those values into the memory locations pointed to by &size_x and &size_y. This is done through pass-by-reference using pointers.

🎯Here's how it works:

int size_x;  // Will store the width of the loaded image
int size_y;  // Will store the height of the loaded image

// When this function is called:
game->imgs.player.img = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx, 
                                             "textures/player.xpm", 
                                             &size_x,    // Address of size_x
                                             &size_y);   // Address of size_y

// After the function call:
// - size_x now contains the width of the loaded image
// - size_y now contains the height of the loaded image


📌 MLX_KEY_HOOK()
-------------------------------
mlx_key_hook(game->win, handle_keypress, game);
✔️ First argument: The window to listen for key events
✔️ Second argument: Function pointer to your key handler
✔️ Third argument: A parameter that will be passed to your handler (usually your game struct)

int handle_keypress(int keycode, t_game *game)
{
    // keycode: Automatically filled with the key that was pressed
    // game: Your game structure (passed as the third parameter in mlx_key_hook)
[...] //define the key
}



📌 RENDERING 
-----------------------
Rendering is the process of drawing/displaying images on the screen. In your game:

Each game element (wall, player, etc.) is represented by an image
The mlx_put_image_to_window function places these images at specific coordinates
By doing this for all elements, you create the complete game screen

THE ORDER IN WHICH ELEMENTS ARE RENDERED IS IMPORTANT
WALL> PJ > ITEMS > EXIT

BUT IF YOUR PLAYER IS SEMI TRANSPARENT
Rendering Order: This is the most important consideration. With transparent images, rendering order becomes crucial:
C
int render_frame(t_game *game)
{
    mlx_clear_window(game->mlx, game->win);
    
    // Always render in this order for proper transparency:
    render_map(game);         // 1. Background (floor) and walls first
    render_exit(game);        // 2. Exit (if it has transparency)
    render_collectibles(game);// 3. Collectibles (with transparency)
    render_player(game);      // 4. Player (with transparency) last
    
    return (0);
}

Floor Rendering and Map Representation In your map array, when you have 'P', 'C', or 'E', these positions should also be considered as having a floor underneath. Think of it as layers:
Layer 1: Floor (everywhere except walls)
Layer 2: Game elements (player, collectibles, exit)

Key points:

When the player moves:

Old position ('P') becomes '0' (floor)
New position becomes 'P'
The rendering system will automatically show floor underneath due to the layered approach
When collecting items:

The 'C' position becomes '0' (floor)
The rendering system will show floor there in subsequent frames
The exit ('E') remains in the map array even after the player moves over it:

This way the exit remains visible even if the player steps on it
The rendering order (floor → exit → player) ensures everything looks correct
Here's a visualization of the layers when rendering:

Code
Map Array:    '0' '1' 'P' 'C' 'E'
              │   │   │   │   │
Layer 1:    Floor  Wall  Floor Floor Floor
Layer 2:     ---  ---  Player Item Exit
=====================================================================================
4. Game Loop

Main game loop starts with mlx_loop()
Handles keyboard input through ft_key_press:
- Arrow keys for movement
- ESC to exit ✅
- Updates game state:
- Player position
- Collectibles collected
- Move counter
- Win/lose conditions

TEST
- ENEMIGOS no deben borrar collect or exit
- player debe perder si toca un enemigo o si enemigo lo choca
- solo puede irse si tiene todos os items

WHY IS IT game AND NOT *game IN MAIN()
Let me explain why game in main doesn't need to be declared as a pointer (t_game *game) and should remain as a regular structure variable (t_game game).

There are several important reasons:

Memory Management and Stack vs Heap:

When you declare t_game game in main, the structure is created on the stack
The stack memory is automatically managed (allocated when the function starts, deallocated when it ends)
If you declared t_game *game, you would need to:
C
t_game *game;
game = malloc(sizeof(t_game)); // Manual allocation required
if (!game)
    return (1);
// ... use game
free(game); // Manual deallocation required
Direct Access vs Indirect Access:

With t_game game:
C
game.mlx = mlx_init();
game.win = mlx_new_window(game.mlx, ...);
With t_game *game:
C
game->mlx = mlx_init();
game->win = mlx_new_window(game->mlx, ...);
Direct access is cleaner and slightly more efficient
Lifetime and Scope:

The game structure contains all your program's essential image
You want this image to exist for the entire duration of your program
Stack allocation in main guarantees this (it lives as long as main runs)
You don't need the flexibility of heap allocation here
MLX Event Handling:

When setting up event hooks, you pass &game to give MLX access to your structure:
C
mlx_hook(game.win, 17, 0, close_window, &game);
This creates a pointer when needed, without storing the structure itself as a pointer
Here's a metaphor that might help:

Think of game like your game's control panel
You want the actual panel (the structure) in your main room (main function)
When someone needs to make changes (like close_window), you give them directions to the panel (a pointer using &)
You don't want just directions to a panel (pointer) in your main room - you want the actual panel
So in summary:

C
int main(void)
{
    t_game game;        // ✅ The actual control panel
    // vs
    t_game *game;       // ❌ Just directions to a control panel that doesn't exist yet
This approach gives you:

Automatic memory management
Direct access to structure members
Clear ownership of the image
The ability to share the address when needed (using &game)

Answer: Freeing Enemy Memory
✅ Yes, free(game->enemies); is enough to free the allocated memory for enemies.
🚨 You do NOT need free_list() because:
free_list() is designed for freeing linked lists (t_map *map), but we are using an array (t_coord *enemies).
An array only needs free(game->enemies); to release the allocated block.
Since enemies is dynamically allocated with malloc(), a single free() is sufficient.

📌 Enemy Implementation Summary for Documentation
🔹 Why Use an Array for Enemies?
We store enemy positions in a dynamically allocated array (t_coord *enemies) inside t_game.
Since the number of enemies is fixed and known at game start (from the .ber map file), an array is the most efficient choice.

✅ Advantages of Using an Array
✔ Faster access: Each enemy’s position is accessed instantly using indexing (enemies[i]).
✔ Less memory overhead: Unlike a linked list, an array does not require extra pointers for each element.
✔ Easier to iterate: The for/while loop directly accesses elements, making movement simpler.

❌ Disadvantages of Using an Array
✖ Fixed size: The array size is determined at game start and cannot dynamically grow or shrink.
✖ Memory allocation upfront: We must allocate memory for all enemies at once, even if some are removed later.

🔹 Functions for Enemy Implementation
📌 1. find_enemies()
📍 Purpose: Finds all enemy ('X') positions in the map and stores them in game->enemies.

📍 Breakdown:
✅ Calls count_enemies(game); to count how many enemies exist.
✅ Allocates memory for the enemies array (malloc(sizeof(t_coord) * enemy_count)).
✅ Calls store_enemies(game); to save each enemy's (x, y) position in the array.

📍 Why is this needed?

Ensures all enemies are tracked in memory so they can move.
Runs once at game start.
📌 2. count_enemies()
📍 Purpose: Scans the map and counts the total number of enemies ('X').

📍 Breakdown:
✅ Loops through game->array_map using while loops.
✅ Increments game->enemy_count for every 'X' found.

📍 Why is this needed?

Determines how much memory to allocate for game->enemies.
📌 3. store_enemies()
📍 Purpose: Stores each enemy’s position in the game->enemies array.

📍 Breakdown:
✅ Iterates through game->array_map using while loops.
✅ Saves (x, y) coordinates of each enemy in game->enemies[count].

📍 Why is this needed?

Ensures enemies remember their positions so they can move.
📌 4. move_enemies()
📍 Purpose: Moves each enemy left or right (if possible) every frame.

📍 Breakdown:
✅ Loops through game->enemies using while.
✅ Checks if the left position is free (FLOOR), moves left if true.
✅ If left is blocked, checks the right position (FLOOR) and moves right.
✅ Calls update_enemy_pos(game, i, new_x, new_y); to update the enemy’s position.

📍 Why is this needed?

Moves enemies automatically every frame inside render_frame().
If an enemy reaches the player, the game ends immediately.
📌 5. update_enemy_pos()
📍 Purpose: Updates enemy position in game->array_map and detects player collision.

📍 Breakdown:
✅ If the new position contains PJ, game over (close_handler()).
✅ Updates game->array_map to move the enemy.
✅ Updates game->enemies[i] with new (x, y).

📍 Why is this needed?

Keeps movement logic separate from decision-making (move_enemies()).
Prevents map corruption by ensuring enemies update correctly.
📌 6. Freeing Enemy Memory in close_window()
📍 Purpose: Frees the dynamically allocated game->enemies array when the game exits.

📍 Breakdown:
✅ If game->enemies is not NULL, call free(game->enemies);.

📍 Why is this needed?

Prevents memory leaks when the game closes.
🔹 How Everything Works Together
Game Start (game_start())
1️⃣ Find all enemies → find_enemies().
2️⃣ Store their positions → store_enemies().
3️⃣ Enemies are now tracked in game->enemies[].

During the Game (render_frame())
1️⃣ Enemies move every frame → move_enemies().
2️⃣ Each enemy updates its position → update_enemy_pos().
3️⃣ If an enemy reaches the player, the game ends.

Game Exit
1️⃣ Memory is freed → free(game->enemies);.

🎯 Summary of Implementation
✔ Enemies are stored in an array (t_coord *enemies).
✔ They move left or right in move_enemies().
✔ If they touch the player, game over.
✔ Memory is properly freed at game exit.

Understanding the Flickering Issue
From what you described, the issue is likely happening because all images are being re-rendered on every frame without double buffering.
📌 Possible causes of the flicker:

mlx_clear_window() in render_frame() (in mlx_load_render.c)
This clears everything before redrawing, which can cause a visible flicker.
Lack of double buffering
MiniLibX does not use double buffering by default.
Each frame is drawn directly to the window, making rendering appear unstable.
Inefficient Redrawing
The game re-renders the entire screen even when only a small portion has changed.
Solution: Enable Double Buffering
How?
Instead of drawing directly on the screen, draw everything to an "off-screen" image (buffer) first.
Once the entire frame is ready, copy it to the window in one step.
This avoids flickering caused by clearing and redrawing partial images.
Implementation Plan
Modify t_game to add a back buffer (an off-screen image).
Render everything to the buffer instead of the window.
Display the fully rendered buffer in one go.

I'll help you implement player animation with multiple sprites. First, let's look at how to organize the player sprites and then implement the animation system.

First, update your game structure to handle multiple player sprites:
C
// In your header file (so_long.h)
typedef struct s_player
{
    int x;
    int y;
    int frame;          // Current animation frame
    int direction;      // Current facing direction
    void *sprite_1;     // First sprite
    void *sprite_2;     // Second sprite
    int anim_counter;   // Counter for animation timing
} t_player;

// Animation constants
#define ANIM_SPEED 10    // Lower number = faster animation
#define SPRITE_1   0
#define SPRITE_2   1
Modified image loading function to handle multiple player sprites:
C
int load_game_images(t_game *game)
{
    int size_x;
    int size_y;
    
    // Load regular images
    game->imgs.wall.img = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx, 
        "textures/wall.xpm", &size_x, &size_y);
    if (!game->imgs.wall.img || size_x != TILE_SIZE || size_y != TILE_SIZE)
        return (error_handler(game, "Failed to load wall image"));
    
    // Load player sprites
    game->player.sprite_1 = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx,
        "textures/player1.xpm", &size_x, &size_y);
    if (!game->player.sprite_1 || size_x != TILE_SIZE || size_y != TILE_SIZE)
        return (error_handler(game, "Failed to load player sprite 1"));
        
    game->player.sprite_2 = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx,
        "textures/player2.xpm", &size_x, &size_y);
    if (!game->player.sprite_2 || size_x != TILE_SIZE || size_y != TILE_SIZE)
        return (error_handler(game, "Failed to load player sprite 2"));
    
    // Initialize player animation state
    game->player.frame = SPRITE_1;
    game->player.anim_counter = 0;
    
    // ... load other game images ...
    return (1);
}
Updated move_player function with animation:
C
int move_player(t_game *game, int dx, int dy)
{
    int new_x = game->player.x + dx;
    int new_y = game->player.y + dy;
    
    // Check if new position is valid
    if (game->array_map[new_y][new_x] == '1')
        return (0);
        
    // Handle collectible
    if (game->array_map[new_y][new_x] == 'C')
    {
        game->items--;
        game->array_map[new_y][new_x] = '0';
    }
    
    // Handle exit
    if (game->array_map[new_y][new_x] == 'E')
    {
        if (game->items == 0)
        {
            ft_printf("Congratulations! Game completed in %d moves!\n", 
                     game->moves + 1);
            close_window(game);
        }
        return (0);
    }
    
    // Update player position
    game->array_map[game->player.y][game->player.x] = '0';
    game->array_map[new_y][new_x] = 'P';
    game->player.x = new_x;
    game->player.y = new_y;
    
    // Update animation state
    game->player.frame = (game->player.frame == SPRITE_1) ? SPRITE_2 : SPRITE_1;
    game->moves++;
    
    return (1);
}
Add a render_player function for drawing the animated player:
C
void render_player(t_game *game)
{
    void *current_sprite;
    
    // Choose which sprite to display
    if (game->player.frame == SPRITE_1)
        current_sprite = game->player.sprite_1;
    else
        current_sprite = game->player.sprite_2;
    
    // Draw the player at their current position
    mlx_put_image_to_window(game->mlx, game->win, current_sprite,
        game->player.x * TILE_SIZE, game->player.y * TILE_SIZE);
}

/* // FUNCION RENDER PLAYER SI IMPLEMENTO SPRITES
void	render_player(t_game *game)
{
	void *current_sprite;

	// If you have animation implemented
	if (game->player.frame == SPRITE_1)
		current_sprite = game->player.sprite_1;
	else
		current_sprite = game->player.sprite_2;

	// If no animation, just use single sprite
	// current_sprite = game->imgs.player.img;

	mlx_put_image_to_window(game->mlx, game->win, current_sprite,
		game->player.x * TILE_SIZE, game->player.y * TILE_SIZE);
}
*/

Update your render_frame function to handle animation:
C
int render_frame(t_game *game)
{
    // Clear window
    mlx_clear_window(game->mlx, game->win);
    
    // Render map (walls, floor, etc.)
    render_map(game);
    
    // Handle player animation timing
    game->player.anim_counter++;
    if (game->player.anim_counter >= ANIM_SPEED)
    {
        game->player.anim_counter = 0;
        // Toggle animation frame when not moving
        if (game->moves > 0)  // Only animate if player has moved
            game->player.frame = (game->player.frame == SPRITE_1) ? 
                                SPRITE_2 : SPRITE_1;
    }
    
    // Render player with current animation frame
    render_player(game);
    
    // Render other elements
    render_collectibles(game);
    render_exit(game);
    
    return (0);
}
Don't forget to update your cleanup function:
C
void cleanup_player_sprites(t_game *game)
{
    if (game->player.sprite_1)
        mlx_destroy_image(game->mlx, game->player.sprite_1);
    if (game->player.sprite_2)
        mlx_destroy_image(game->mlx, game->player.sprite_2);
}
This implementation provides:

Two-frame player animation
Animation timing control
Sprite alternation on movement
Proper cleanup of resources
You can adjust the ANIM_SPEED constant to make the animation faster or slower. A lower number means faster animation.

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or help you implement additional features like:

Direction-specific sprites (different sprites for up/down/left/right)
Smoother movement animation
More complex animation patterns?
