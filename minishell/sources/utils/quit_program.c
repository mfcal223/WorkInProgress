** üîç Why is this memory still reachable?
Valgrind is telling you that some memory was not freed at exit, but it was not leaked ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs still referenced and could theoretically be freed, 
but wasn't. This is by design in some libraries like readline.

GNU Readline internally allocates memory for command history, terminal handling, keymaps, and prompt management.

These allocations are never freed explicitly unless you call certain teardown functions (which aren't required for most shell usage).

‚úÖ Is this a real problem?
No. Here‚Äôs why:
- These are not leaks. Valgrind even says:
			definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
			indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
- It is just memory that wasn't freed on exit, but it's still accessible and accounted for. So technically: "still reachable."

üßº Want to clean it up?
If you're being extra strict (e.g., for school or bonus points), you can explicitly clean up Readline:
			rl_clear_history(); // Frees command history
But you‚Äôll still see some ‚Äúreachable‚Äù memory due to deeper Readline internals unless you patch or recompile Readline itself ‚Äî 
which is overkill and not required by the subject.
